    "content": "A sinus is a hollow cavity within the bones of the skull or face, which is lined with a thin, moist tissue called the mucosa. Sinusitis is an inflammation of these cavities, often due to infection, which can cause symptoms such as pain, congestion, and difficulty breathing. Latest treatments, like functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) and balloon sinuplasty, offer minimally invasive options for sinusitis.",
