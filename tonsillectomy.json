    "content": "Tonsillectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the tonsils, which are small gland-like structures located at the back of the throat. They help to protect the body against infections. Tonsillectomy is often performed when a patient experiences recurrent or chronic tonsillitis, or other tonsil-related complications. Latest treatments, such as laser tonsillectomy and coblation tonsillectomy, offer minimally invasive options compared to traditional procedures.",
