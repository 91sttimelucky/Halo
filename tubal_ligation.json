    "content": "Tubal ligation, also known as 'tubectomy' or 'tubes tied,' is a surgical procedure for women who want permanent birth control. During the procedure, the fallopian tubes are sealed, preventing the eggs from traveling down the tubes and sperm from reaching the eggs. Latest techniques, such as laparoscopic tubal ligation, offer a minimally invasive approach compared to traditional methods.",
